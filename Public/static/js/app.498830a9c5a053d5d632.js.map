(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n         *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n         *\n         * So what to do?  The is the best:\n         *\n         *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n         *\n         * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n         * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n         *\n         *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n         *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n         *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n         *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n         *\n         * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n         * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n         * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n         * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n         * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n         * linear speed or acceleration.\n         *\n         * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n         *\n         *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n         *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n         *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n         *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n         *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n         *\n         *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n         *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n         *     pixels!\n         *\n         *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n         *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n         *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n         *\n         * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n         *\n         *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n         *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n         *\n         *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n         *\n         *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n         *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n         *     you know.\n         *\n         * Implementation info:\n         *\n         * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n         * average mouse:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n         *\n         * On the trackpad:\n         *\n         *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n         *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n         *\n         * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n         * also missing delta values.\n         *\n         * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n         *\n         * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n         *\n         * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n         * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.

It _can_ report incompatible changes\n//   to the attributes of non-own, inherited properties.\n// - defineProperty cannot make incompatible changes to the attributes of\n//   sealed properties\n// - deleteProperty cannot report a successful deletion of a sealed property\n// - hasOwn cannot report a sealed property as non-existent\n// - has cannot report a sealed property as non-existent\n// - get cannot report inconsistent values for frozen data\n//   properties, and must report undefined for sealed accessors with an\n//   undefined getter\n// - set cannot report a successful assignment for frozen data\n//   properties or sealed accessors with an undefined setter.\n// - get{Own}PropertyNames lists all sealed properties of the target.\n// - keys lists all enumerable sealed properties of the target.\n// - enumerate lists all enumerable sealed properties of the target.\n// - if a property of a non-extensible proxy is reported as non-existent,\n//   then it must forever be reported as non-existent. This applies to\n//   own and inherited properties and is enforced in the\n//   deleteProperty, get{Own}PropertyDescriptor, has{Own},\n//   get{Own}PropertyNames, keys and enumerate traps\n\n// Violation of any of these invariants by H will result in TypeError being\n// thrown.\n\n// Additionally, once Object.preventExtensions, Object.seal or Object.freeze\n// is invoked on the proxy, the set of own property names for the proxy is\n// fixed. Any property name that is not fixed is called a 'new' property.\n\n// The Validator upholds the following invariants regarding extensibility:\n// - getOwnPropertyDescriptor cannot report new properties as existent\n//   (it must report them as non-existent by returning undefined)\n// - defineProperty cannot successfully add a new property (it must reject)\n// - getOwnPropertyNames cannot list new properties\n// - hasOwn cannot report true for new properties (it must report false)\n// - keys cannot list new properties\n\n// Invariants currently not enforced:\n// - getOwnPropertyNames lists only own property names\n// - keys lists only enumerable own property names\n// Both traps may list more property names than are actually defined on the\n// target.\n\n// Invariants with regard to inheritance are currently not enforced.\n// - a non-configurable potentially inherited property on a proxy with\n//   non-mutable ancestry cannot be reported as non-existent\n// (An object with non-mutable ancestry is a non-extensible object whose\n// [[Prototype]] is either null or an object with non-mutable ancestry.)\n\n// Changes in Handler API compared to previous harmony:proxies, see:\n// http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:direct_proxies\n// http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:direct_proxies\n\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n// ---- WeakMap polyfill ----\n\n// TODO: find a proper WeakMap polyfill\n\n// define an empty WeakMap so that at least the Reflect module code\n// will work in the absence of WeakMaps.

Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n     * with `_#value`.\n     *\n     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n     * enabled using `_.chain`.\n     *\n     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n     *\n     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut\n     * fusion is subject to change.\n     *\n     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n     *\n     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n     *\n     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`\n     *\n     * The wrapper `String` methods are:\n     * `replace` and `split`\n     *\n     * The wrapper methods that
