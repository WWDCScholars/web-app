    <h3>Data protection</h3>
    <p>The operators of this website/app and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection
      Declaration.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever you use this website/app, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we
      use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
    <p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.</p>
    <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the „controller“ in the GDPR)</h3>
    <p>The data processing controller on this website/of this app is:</p>
    <p>corporatr GmbH<br /> represented by the managing director Oliver Eckert<br /> Lindpaintnerstraße 88<br /> 70195 Stuttgart</p>

    <p>Phone: +49 711 13203200<br /> E-mail: hello@corporatr.com</p>
    <p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
    <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
    <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal notification via e-mail.
      This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
    <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p><strong>In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).</strong></p>
    <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred.
      The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the
      direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p>
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website/app operator, this website/app uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption programme. You can recognise an encrypted
      connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from „http://“ to „https://“ and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
    <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h3>Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right
      to have your data rectified, blocked or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required
      by Law.“</p>
    <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
    <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required by Law.“ The right to demand restriction
      of processing applies in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of
        your personal data.</li>
      <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.</li>
      <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.</li>
      <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the
        processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural
      persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>

    <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Article
      6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.</p>
    <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular

    <p>The data recorded during the registration process shall be stored by us as long as you are registered on our website/in our app. Subsequently, such data shall be deleted. This shall be without prejudice to mandatory statutory retention obligations.</p>
    <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>
    <p>We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the establishment, content organization or change of the legal relationship (data inventory). These actions are taken on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits
      the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual actions. We collect, process and use personal data concerning the use of our website/app (usage data) only to the extent that this is necessary to make it possible for users

      the subscriber lives in into account. SendGrid also offers us the option to divide newsletter recipients into groups based on their interests. This allows us to send our newsletter subscribers content that is the most compatible with their respective
      interests.</p>
