      h3 Recover your legacy account
      p.
        Did you sign up for a WWDCScholars profile before 2017 using
        email and password credentials? We switched to iCloud
        authentication, which requires linking your legacy profile
        with your iCloud account to make your profile public again.
        The process only takes a few minutes. Sign in above and
        follow the instructions to recover your legacy account.

      h3 Accept our privacy policy
      p.
        Did you sign up before May 2018 and can't find your profile
        on our website or app anymore? Due to changes in government
        regulations, we must obtain consent for the public display of
        your information. You can sign in above to accept our privacy
        policy and update your profile at any time.
