# [WWDCScholars Website](https://www.wwdcscholars.com) &middot; [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dfda3ed0-fe8b-4cc7-a051-f39126a20128/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wwdcscholars/deploys)
WWDCScholars is a community of [Apple WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/) winners. Every year bright minds from all around the world compete against each other for a free ticket to Apple's yearly developers conference. The scholarship recipients share their winning projects in [our iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scholars-of-wwdc/id999731893?mt=8) and on [our website (www.wwdcscholars.com)](https://www.wwdcscholars.com).

This repository contains the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) based website that lists current and previous scholarship winners from all around the world.

## Getting Started
WWDCScholars is based on [Apple's BaaS, CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/). To use this project you need to obtain credentials for [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloudKitQuickStart/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014987), the [Apple MapKit JS API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/) and the [Sentry Error Tracking Service](https://sentry.io/).

#### Create a `.env` file at the root of this project that looks like this:
```
DEV_CLOUDKIT_CONTAINER_IDENTIFIER="<CloudKit Container Identifier>"
DEV_CLOUDKIT_API_TOKEN="<CloudKit API Token>"
DEV_CLOUDKIT_ENVIRONMENT="<CloudKit Environment>"

DEV_MAPKIT_JWT="<MapKit JS JWT>"

SENTRY_DSN="<Sentry DSN>"
DEV_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT="<Sentry Environment>"

DEV_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN="" # no analytics for dev environment

WWDC_YEAR="<The WWDCYear key to use>"
```

#### Install dependencies
```
$ yarn install
```

#### Build and run the app
- In development mode using a local development server with hot-reload, etc.
  ```
  $ yarn dev
  ```
- In production mode for static hosting
  ```
  $ yarn build
  ```
When building for production you can find the results in `dist/`.

A 404 page can be found at `dist/404.html`. You can use it in nginx like this:
```
server {
  ...
  root /path/to/build/output;
  error_page 404 /404.html;
}
```
